Repository for the As Yet Unnamed project for Group 13 in COP4331 Spring2020

# Product Vision

This product is for any individual or organization organizing an event who need to seat their guests in a way which helps the event flow more smoothly.  The interactive seating chart  leads to better organization of your event and less stress during event planning. Unlike many other floor planning programs which allow the user to create a layout of their event and seat their guests, our product offers an automated way of planning a seating chart based on the guest preferences.
